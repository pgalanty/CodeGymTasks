//1. The program should display text on the screen.
//2. Don't change the line responsible for screen output.
//3. The Cat class must have only one count variable.
//4. The Cat class's variable count must be a static int, have a public access modifier, and be initialized to zero.
//5. The main method should have only two initialized Cat variables.
//6. The variable count must store the actual number of cat objects created.
