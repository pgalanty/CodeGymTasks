//1. The program should display text on the screen.
//2. The Apple class's addPrice method should not display text on the screen.
//3. The Apple class's applePrice variable must be a static int initialized to zero.
//4. The main method should call the addPrice method only twice.
//5. The Apple class's addPrice method should increase the cost of apples by the passed-in value.
